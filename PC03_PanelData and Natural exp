#1 OLS to estimate the effect of excutions over the pas 3 years on murders while controling for unemployment
## 
lm(formula = mrdrte ~ exec + unem)
#There is no evidence of a deterrent effect because the estimated coefficient for executions is positive and not statistically significant. Unemployment tends to reflect socioeconomic deprivation and therefore (may) correlate with the number of murders. 

#2. FD method to evaluate the effect of punishment on murders on unemployment
## Assume homoscedasticity

fd1 <- plm(mrdrte~exec+unem, index=c("state","year"), data=data, model=c("fd"))
coeftest(fd1)

#The effect of punishment is now negative but still insignificant. 

#3. question 2 with heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors
## Differences in the standard errors 

coeftest(fd1, vcov=vcovHC)
#Standard errors corrected for heteroscedasticity get smaller. Thus, the estimated deterrent effects become statistically significant at the 1% level

#4. FE to evaluate the effect of punishment on murders conditional on unemployment
## Report heteroscedasticity and cluster-robust SE, accounting for clustering on the state level
## Compare your results to (3)

fe1= plm(mrdrte~exec+unem, index=c("year","state"), data=data, model=c("within"))
coef_test(fe1, vcov = vcovHC,  cluster = state)
vcovCR(fe1, cluster = state)


#Using the fixed effect method leads to a deterrent effect which is not statistically significant.
